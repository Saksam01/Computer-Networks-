Pretty little baby (yeah, yeah)
Pretty little baby (yeah, yeah)
Pretty little baby, you say that maybe
You'll be thinkin' of me, and try to love me
Pretty little baby
I'm hoping that you do
You can ask the flowers, I sit for hours
Tellin' all the bluebirds, the bill and coo birds
Pretty little baby
I'm so in love with you
